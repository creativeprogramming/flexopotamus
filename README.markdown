# A responsive, small screen first WordPress starter theme based on Twenty-Ten. #

## Create a child theme ##
Create a directory in the themes folder alongside the Flexopotamus parent theme and add a <code>style.css</code> file. Initialize the child theme and copy over the Flexopotamus css:

<pre>
/*
	Theme Name: your child theme
	Theme URL: http://urlhere.com
	Description: Custom theme created for url.com.
	Author: Your Name
	Version: 1.0
	
	Template: Flexopotamus
*/

// Copy and paste the css code in flexopotamus/style.css here. Then add you child theme specific styles after. 
// ### DON'T USE "@import" STATEMENTS! THE RESPONSIVE JAVASCRIPT WON'T WORK IF YOU DO. ###
</pre>
